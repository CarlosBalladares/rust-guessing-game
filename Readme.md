# Notes

Chapter 2 rust book


* `use` keyword brings in libraries.
* Rust brings in scope the prelude by default, you import whatever is no on prelude.
* main is the entrypoint

## values and vars
* variables and mutability, variables are decalared with `let` and are immutable by default 
* use the `mut` keyword to make a word mutable.

## match
* match keywork works as a switch statement, arbitrary logic can be used when a result is matched. 
* loop similar to while
